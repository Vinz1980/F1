## Constructors championship
Quite early on it becme apparent that McLaren had a very strong car and with 2 drivers consistently scoring points, they were headed in the right direction.
RedBull were struggling with 1 car hardly scoring any points. But luckily for them Max Verstappen was maximizing every race and even though they were not competitive he scored points every weekend.
Ferrari and Mercedes were also in the mix, scoring good amounts of point on a regular basis.
Halfway through the season it became apparent that McLaren would win the constructor championship. It was just a matter of when.. not if.
## Drivers championship
From the very start Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris were consistently scoring points getting race wins, 1,2 finish and were at the top of the rankings from the start.
