## Season 2025
### Championship deciders
## Constructors championship
Quite early on it becme apparent that McLaren had a very strong car and with 2 drivers consistently scoring points, they were headed in the right direction.
RedBull were struggling with 1 car hardly scoring any points. But luckily for them Max Verstappen was maximizing every race and even though they were not competitive he scored points every weekend.
Ferrari and Mercedes were also in the mix, scoring good amounts of point on a regular basis.
Halfway through the season it became apparent that McLaren would win the constructor championship. It was just a matter of when.. not if.
## Drivers championship
From the very start Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris were consistently scoring points getting race wins, 1,2 finish and were at the top of the rankings from the start.
Behind that the drivers of Ferrari, Mercedes and RedBulls' Max were fighting for third place.
Outstanding performance of Max Verstappen in a RedBull that was underperforming lead to him getting decent points and even a couple of race wins.
Every weekend he was maximizing and trying to fall behind as little as possible.
The RedBull car needed development and this took time, and so at some point Max was 104 points behind Championship leader Piastri.
Than halfway through the season, and with some update in Monza, the tide started turning, Max in his RedBull was way more competitive and getting pole positions and race wins.
meanwhile McLaren started to struggle more, making mistakes, drivers fighting on track and losing points. 
After the summer break and since the Monza update on the RedBull, Max seems to be flying again.
Claiming a couple of race wins, and Norris and Piastri losing points.
A crucial weekend was the race in the USA on COTA. In the sprint race the 2 McLarens touched in 1st corner and ended their race. Max won.
After that Max took pole position in qualifying and also won the race. Ultimately bringing the gap that was once 104 point down to 40 points.
## Season Finale
5 weekends to go of which 2 sprint format weekends.
The race is on! Max will be fighting to get his 5th Championship whereas Oscar and Lando are both trying to secure their 1st.
